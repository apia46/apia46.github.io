# 3d tech demo thing
## everything you see is an html element

based on [corru.observer](https://corru.observer); [this page](https://corru.observer/local/beneath?force) is a good example.
i wanted to figure it out for myself, so i recreated it, with some additional features of my own, of course.
tested on firefox win11; not sure if other configurations work (i know macos doesnt like it; sorry about that)

## controls:
w/uparrow: move forward
a/leftarrow: strafe left
s/downarrow: move backward
d/rightarrow: strafe right
q/z: turn counterclockwise
e/x: turn clockwise
spacebar: toggle lookaround mode (click and drag to move camera)
