# 3d tech demo thing
## everything you see is an html element

based on [corru.observer](https://corru.observer); [this page](https://corru.observer/local/beneath?force) is a good example
i wanted to figure it out for myself, so i recreated it.
with some additional features of my own, of course
tested on firefox win11; not sure if other configurations work (i know macos doesnt like it; sorry about that)
